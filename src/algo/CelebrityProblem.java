/**
 * The famous Celebrity problem
 * 
 * You are in a party of N people, where only one person is known to everyone.
 * Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesnâ€™t know anyone
 * in the party. Your task is to find the stranger (celebrity) in party. You
 * will be given a square matrix M[][] where if an element of row i and column j
 * is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to complete the
 * function getId() which finds the id of the celebrity if present else return
 * -1. The function getId() takes two arguments, the square matrix M and its
 * size N.
 * 
 * Note: Expected time complexity is O(N) with constant extra space.
 * 
 * Input: The first line of input contains an element T denoting the number of
 * test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of 2 lines. The
 * first line of each test case contains a number denoting the size of the
 * matrix M. Then in the next line are space separated values of the matrix M.
 * 
 * Output: For each test case output will be the id of the celebrity if present
 * (0 based index). Else -1 will be printed.
 * 
 * User Task: The task is to complete the function getId() which returns the Id
 * of celebrity if present, else -1.
 * 
 * Constraints: 1 <= T <= 50 2 <= N <= 501 0 <= M[][] <= 1
 * 
 * Example: Input (To be used only for expected output) : 2 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
 * 2 0 1 1 0
 * 
 * Output : 1 -1
 * 
 * Explanation : For the above test case the matrix will look like 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
 * 1 0 Here, the celebrity is the person with index 1 ie id 1
