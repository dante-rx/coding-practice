/**
 * 
 * There are N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. Each hole can
 * accomodate only 1 mouse. A mouse can stay at his position, move one step
 * right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these
 * moves consumes 1 minute. Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last
 * mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * positions of mice are: 4 -4 2 positions of holes are: 4 0 5
 * 
 * Assign mouse at position x=4 to hole at position x=4 : Time taken is 0
 * minutes Assign mouse at position x=-4 to hole at position x=0 : Time taken is
 * 4 minutes Assign mouse at position x=2 to hole at position x=5 : Time taken
 * is 3 minutes After 4 minutes all of the mice are in the holes.
 * 
 * Since, there is no combination possible where the last mouse's time is less
 * than 4, answer = 4.
